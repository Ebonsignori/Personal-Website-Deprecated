# Ebonsignori.com
My working portfolio and blog planned for ebonsignori.com

Currently very much a work in progress.

# Goals:
- [ ] Add consistent stying to each page
- [ ] Implement Blog
- [ ] Implement Contact Forms
- [ ] Learn how to imbed a java application into site and include it on portfolio

# Long Term:
- [ ] Add git server on hosting site
- [ ] Start hosting site from scratch using amazon web services or similar
- [ ] Complete and add additional projects to portfolio 

# Ideas:
-Colored/Themed Box that acts as the "How I did this" for each element.
-Kind of like a tour of a site or program that highlights each feature and lets you press next, a guided tour persay.
-Have Option to turn off and on the guide on every page. Start the page prompting if the user desires to use the guide.
